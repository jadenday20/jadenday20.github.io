                    <h3>Violin</h3>
                    <p>Violins are the highest instruments in a traditional string orchestra. They are typically split into two sections,
                        a 1st violin section and a 2nd violin section. The 1st violin section tends to play most of the melody.

                    <h3>Viola</h3>
                    <p>Violas are often mistaken for violins. Aside from the slight difference in size these instruments look almost 
                        identical! While they do look very similar, the viola does make a much deeper sound than that of the violin.

                    <h3>Cello</h3>
                    <p>Cellos are the next size up from violas. They have a significantly deaper sound, but the general principles 
                        for playing them are generally the same. Cello players mostly play while seated, with the cello placed between
                        the knees.

                    <h3>Double Bass</h3>
                    <p>The double bass, or bass as it is usually called, is (surprise!) even larger than a cello. Because the bass is so
                        tall, bass players can't play while seated in a normal chair. Instead, they have to stand or sit on a tall stool
                        in order to play.
