        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>To educate people about the concepts of string instruments and orchestras.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Anyone who is new to string instruments and orchestras.</p>
        <h3>My Pitch</h3>
        <p>Have you ever been curious about orchestral music? Have you ever wanted to know more about just what exactly goes into the beautiful music you love?
        My name is Jaden Day, and I am a violinist. My website will break down all of the many components that make up a string orchestra, from instruments
        to techniques to vocabulary. My goal is to help you better understand the orchestra experience one concept at a time.</p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: "Acme"</h4>
        <p>The reason that I chose this heading font is because it looks fun and I want my site to feel fun.</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: "Georgia"</h4>
        <p>I chose this font because it isn't too loud, but it also isn't boring.</p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>We offer a complete package for whatever your needs are in relation to temple service and accomodations. Our
            shuttle runs to meet the endowment schedule and our babysitting servcies provide an afforable and safe
            alternative for your family.</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as you transition from
            traveling to the temple to actually entering the temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and
            freshing up in order to focus on meaningful service. Let us take care of you.</p>
