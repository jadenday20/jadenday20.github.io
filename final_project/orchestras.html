                    <h3>String Sections</h3>
                    <p>In an orchestra the musicians are split into different sections. Each of these sections play
                        different parts. In my high school orchestra (and in most string orchestras) there were five 
                        different sections: The 1st and 2nd violin sections, the viola section, the cello section
                        and the bass section. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Melody</h3>
                    <p>The melody is the "main" part the listener is suposed to pay attention to. It is very common
                        for the 1st violin to have the melody, but ochasionally another section will have the melody.
                        This is the case in this excerpt from the Advent Chamber Orchestra's Cello Concerto in G major.
                        In this piece, the cello plays the melody for much of the song:

                    <h3>The Harmonies</h3>
                    <p>The harmonies are all of the parts besides the melody that go into a musical peice. These are
                        all of the other parts that enrich the melody and make it sound more complete.

                    <h3>The Conductor</h3>
                    <p>The conductor is the one who stands at the front of the orchestra with a button. He is the one
                        that guides the orchestra and comunicates when to get louder and when to get softer. He signals
                        the orchestra when it is time to go faster and when it is time to go slower. Sometimes the
                        conductor will signal to a section when it is their turn to come in. He is the glue that holds
                        everyone together.
